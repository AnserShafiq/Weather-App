# Learned New JavaScript Feature Fetch()
In this project i learned how we can use fetch in javaScript to get data from different Api's. First I added Eventlistener with button variable with the string 'click' and new function with body. When my button will get clicked so the eventlistener will take the program into function where it will use fetch command to fetch the data from the API i used. And in that API also sent the input of the user. Then used .then function to check the response of fetch if the response remained true then next .then function will create a data variable and will store required info the in that data variable to share on screen otherwise my program will go on .catch and will send alert.
